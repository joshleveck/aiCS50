These are Week 0 projects. 
The first one is figuring out how many degrees of seperation seperate two actors. Based on the game Six Degrees of Seperation with Kevin Bacon, it uses the IMDB database
the seach for the actors.

The second one is an AI for a TicTacToe game. Very similar to the one I created using JavaScript for Mancala.
